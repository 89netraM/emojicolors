# Emoji Colors

Have you ever wanted to get the colors of an emoji? Well, now you can!

[`./emojicolors.json`](./emojicolors.json) contains a map from emojis to
primary, secondary, and average colors.

The information is scraped from Unicode's [official website](http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html)
for emojis, and the colors are gathered from Twitter's emoji font.
